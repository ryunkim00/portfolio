          team developing in-demand features for internal tools, such as Coach
          Portal used by coaches to manage their clients, managing Carrot's
          AWS-hosted infrastructure via Terraform, and leaving behind a
          revenue-generating legacy by fully implementing a streamlined
          re-enrollment flow with automatic sensor renewal. On top of the
          technical work, I was mentored by seasoned software engineers on the
          team, learning everything from best coding practices to life advice. I
          am grateful for the opportunity to work on tech that empowers people
          to be the best version of themselves as shown by a continuous stream
          of testimonies from ex-smokers whose lives have been changed for the
          better.
